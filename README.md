[![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/Graylog2/graylog-plugin-threatintel.svg)](https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog-plugin-threatintel/releases)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Graylog2/graylog-plugin-threatintel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Graylog2/graylog-plugin-threatintel)

**Required Graylog version:** 2.4.0

**This Plugin use external sources to enrich your data - read the documentation before you run this in production**

This plugin adds [Processing Pipeline](http://docs.graylog.org/en/latest/pages/pipelines.html) functions to enrich log messages with threat intelligence data.

## Supported data feeds

* [AlienVault Open Threat Exchange (OTX)](https://otx.alienvault.com/) (One API call per lookup but cached)
  * IP addresses
  * Hostnames
* Tor exit nodes (You'll need at least Java 8 (u101) to make this work. More information below.)
  * IP addresses
* [Spamhaus DROP/EDROP lists](https://www.spamhaus.org/drop/)
  * IP addresses
* [Abuse.ch Ransomware Tracker blocklists](https://ransomwaretracker.abuse.ch/blocklist/)
  * IP addresses
  * Hostnames
* WHOIS information
  * IP addresses

## Example

```
let src_addr_intel = threat_intel_lookup_ip(to_string($message.src_addr), "src_addr");
set_fields(src_addr_intel);
```

Please read the usage instructions below for more information and specific guides.

## Installation
> Since Graylog Version 2.4.0 this plugin is already included in the Graylog server installation package as default plugin.

[Download the plugin](https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog-plugin-threatintel/releases)
and place the `.jar` file in your Graylog plugin directory. The plugin directory
is the `plugins/` folder relative from your `graylog-server` directory by default
and can be configured in your `graylog.conf` file.

Restart `graylog-server` and you are done.

## Usage

Example [Processing Pipeline](http://docs.graylog.org/en/latest/pages/pipelines.html) rules are following:

#### Global/combined threat feed lookup

This is the recommended way to use this plugin. The `threat_intel_lookup_*` function will run an indicator like
an IP address or domain name against all enabled threat intel sources and return a combined result. (Except OTX lookups)

```
let src_addr_intel = threat_intel_lookup_ip(to_string($message.src_addr), "src_addr");
set_fields(src_addr_intel);

let dns_question_intel = threat_intel_lookup_domain(to_string($message.dns_question), "dns_question");
set_fields(dns_question_intel);
```

This will lead to the fields `src_addr_threat_indicated:true|false` and `dns_question_threat_indicated:true|false`
being added to the processed message. It will also add fields like `testing_threat_indicated_abusech_ransomware:true`
(Abuse.ch Ransomware tracker OSINT) to indicate threat intel sources returned matches.

Add a second pipeline step that adds the field `threat_indicated:true` if either of the above fields was true
to allow easier queries for all messages that indicated any kind of threat:

```
rule "inflate threat intel results"
when
  to_bool($message.src_threat_indicated) || to_bool($message.dst_threat_indicated)
then
  set_field("threat_indicated", true);
end
```

#### WHOIS lookups

You can look up WHOIS information about IP addresses. The method will return the registered owner and country code. The lookup results are heavily cached and invalidated after 12 hours or when the `graylog-server` process restarts.

```
let whois_intel = whois_lookup_ip(to_string($message.src_addr), "src_addr")
set_fields(whois_intel);
```

**Note**: The plugin will use the ARIN WHOIS servers for the first lookup because they have the best redirect to other registries in case they are not responsible for the block of the requested IP address. Graylog will follow the redirect to other registries like RIPE-NCC, AFRINI, APNIC or LACNIC. Future versions will support initial lookups in other registries, but for now, you might experience longer latencies if your Graylog cluster is not located in Nort America.

#### OTX

```
let intel = otx_lookup_ip(to_string($message.src_addr));
// let intel = otx_lookup_domain(to_string($message.dns_question))

set_field("threat_indicated", intel.otx_threat_indicated);
set_field("threat_ids", intel.otx_threat_ids);
set_field("threat_names", intel.otx_threat_names);
```

#### Tor exit nodes

You'll need at least Java 8 (u101) to make this work. The exit node information is hosted on a Tor website that uses Let's Encrypt for SSL and only Java 8 (u101 or newer) supports it.

```
  let intel = tor_lookup(to_string($message.src_addr));
  set_field("src_addr_is_tor_exit_node", intel.threat_indicated);
```

#### Spamhaus DROP/EDROP

```
  let intel = spamhaus_lookup_ip(to_string($message.src_addr));
  set_field("threat_indicated", intel.threat_indicated);
```

#### Abuse.ch Ransomware tracker

```
  let intel = abusech_ransom_lookup_domain(to_string($message.dns_domain));
  // let intel = abusech_ransom_lookup_ip(to_string($message.src_addr));
  set_field("request_domain_is_ransomware", intel.threat_indicated);
```

Note that you can combine these and change field names as you wish.

## Performance considerations

* All lookups will automatically skip processing IPv4 addresses from private networks as defined in RFC 1918. (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16)
  * Note that this plugin also ships a new function `in_private_net(ip_address) : Boolean` for any manual lookups of the same kind.
* You can vastly improve performance by connecting pipelines that make use of the threat intelligence rules only to streams that contain data you want to run the lookups on.
